- There are 1154 unique filename that both have VCF file and image file. 
- From this 1154 unique filename, and the overall patient EHR record, there are 583 Patient IDs labeled as Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), only 549 unique patient IDs. 

- Using 549 unique LUAD patient IDs, there are 583 corresponding unqiue filenames in both VCF folder and Image folder. 
	- This suggests that some patients have multiple VCF files. This is because multiple sequencing checks during their treatment. 
	- For cases where patients with multiple VCF files, take the Union of VCF files when checking gene mutations.

# Based on the result, I think the VCF file is processed based on GRCh37/hg19 instead of (GRCh38/hg38). 


- There are 109/544 (20%) LUAD patients have POSITIVE KRAS mutation. 
		- 544 VCF files from 583 is actually non-empty valid VCF file. 
		- From online resource, there are about 33% LUAD patient have KRAS mutation.
			- matches the result. 


- It's actually 107/517 (20%).
